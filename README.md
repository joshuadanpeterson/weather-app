## Overview

The Weather App is an engaging and informative web application that provides real-time weather updates for locations around the world. It offers a visually appealing experience with dynamic background images and icons that change according to the weather conditions. This project was developed by [Your Name] and the [Your Team Name] team as part of a coding project.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background Images:** The app features background images that change according to the weather conditions, creating an immersive visual experience. These images are standardized across cities but adapt to the current weather.

- **Weather Icons:** Weather icons complement the background images, providing users with at-a-glance information about the current conditions.

- **Geolocation:** By default, the app uses the browser's geolocation feature to determine the user's location. This eliminates the need for users to manually input their city.

- **City Search:** Users can also search for specific cities using the search bar located above the weather icon. This feature enables users to check weather information for locations of their choice.

- **Moon Phases:** The app displays moon phases below sunrise and sunset times, enhancing its informative value.

- **Optional Features:**
  - **Site Introduction:** Upon the first launch of the site, users are greeted with the site's name, logo, and engaging animations, providing an enjoyable user experience.
  - **Moon Phases API:** The app leverages the OpenWeather API to incorporate accurate moon phase information, adding an extra layer of detail for enthusiasts.
